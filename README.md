Attempting to modularize the game. Originally all code is within game.py. Click on game(mod version).py to run modulated version. 

Even though Enemies can be modulated with  turtle.ontimer(lambda: self.move(block,bob),t=random.randint(100,300))

it has impacted performance way too much for me to be happy. 

The issue i had with modulating 'Player' Class you can only provide the turtle onkey function with no augment but because you are modulating, 
these need to be added.

I have uploaded both the Player and Enemey modules and respective game file within misc for anyone who fancy to attempt it. 

If anyone can help modulate 'Player' class or/and Enemy Class without effecting performance, it would be appreciative
