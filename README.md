Attempting to modulise the game. Originally all code is within game.py but hopefully we will be able to seperate the code to different modules. (Work in progress ) 

Even though Enemies can be modulated with  turtle.ontimer(lambda: self.move(block,bob),t=random.randint(100,300))

it has impacted performance way too much for me to be happy.  If anyone can help modulate 'PLayer' class or/and Enemy Class without affect performance, it would be appreciative
