based of the Maze Game Tutorial

My version contain additional features such as

1) Levelling system 
2) Side Quests
3) Ending including alternative ending 
4) Multiple dungeons
5) Real time combat system 
6) Hidden locations
7) Variety of enemies ( including boss) 
8) Item pick ups/Equipment upgrade
9) Sound effects and music from freesound.org 
10) Starting Screen 
11) Original Music and Art 

To be honest the maze game tutorial is more of a 'demo' than an actual game.
