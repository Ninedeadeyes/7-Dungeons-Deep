Attempting to modulise the game. Originally all code is within game.py but hopefully we will be able to seperate the code to different modules. (Work in progress ) 


Key features

-Leveling system

-Item pick ups/Equipment upgrade

-Hidden Locations 

-Side Quests 

-Variety of enemies ( including boss ) 

-Alternative ending 

(Still need to clean up the code and label things correctly as well provide additional comments but aside from that the game is basically done ) 

-All graphics created using GraphicsGale and lospec.com/pixel-editor

-All sounds downloaded from https://freesound.org

-To play without python download all files and run the exe file.
